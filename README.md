XBM viewer is created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (ES6). Paste the .xbm content in left textarea to render in right side. You can access the viewer <a href="https://Windows87.github.io/xbm-viewer-converter">here</a>.

It is possible convert an image (png, jpg, jpeg, ico and others) to .xbm in client-side (using canvas). Just click in "Convert Image in XBM", select your file, resize if you want and click in "Convert". This can take time because is converting in client-side instead server-side.
